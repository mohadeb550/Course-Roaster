ðŸ”˜ Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project?

In the beginning, I create a state for data, and then I fetch and store the data in that state. Similarly, I create separate states for 'cart,' 'credit,' 'cost,' and 'totalPrice,' and then work with the data from these states. I pass the state to each component and display the data in the interface. I primarily handle these states and everything works correctly because in React, we don't need to focus on the DOM; just updating the data makes the job done.
